# DTC Raid Tracker (v7.3.13)

**DTC Raid Tracker** is a modular World of Warcraft addon designed to track raid attendance, performance voting, and leaderboard stats. Version 7.1 introduces major architectural improvements and a new **"Game Theory"** module that allows players to leverage gold to influence the vote via Bribes, Propositions, and Lobbying.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Voting System
* **Weighted Voting:** Every raider gets 3 votes per boss kill.
* **Role Sorting:** View the roster sorted by Tank, Healer, and DPS/Other.
* **Smart Validation:** Blocks self-voting and prevents voting if a player has disconnected or has an outdated addon version.
* **Tie-Breakers:** Standardized sorting (highest vote count wins).

### 2. "Game Theory" & Commerce
Turn your raid into a marketplace! Players can now leverage their gold to influence the outcome.
* **💰 Bribes:** Offer gold to a specific player to secure one of their votes.
* **📜 Propositions:** Selling your own vote? Broadcast a "Proposition" to the raid, setting a price for your support.
* **🤝 Lobbying:** Fund a campaign! Pay other players to vote for a specific candidate.
* **Debt Tracking:** The addon tracks who has paid and who owes money.
    * *Deadbeat Protocol:* If you have unpaid debts from a previous boss, your ability to bribe/lobby is disabled until you settle up.
* **Automated Trading:** Clicking "Trade" in the Bribe Ledger automatically opens the trade window and fills in the correct gold amount.

### 3. Leaderboards & History
* **Leaderboard:** Track who has the most votes across the entire expansion, specific raids, or bosses.
* **Detailed History:** A searchable log of every vote cast, complete with dates, difficulty settings, and winners.
* **Export:** Export history data to CSV for external spreadsheet tracking.

### 4. Roster Management
* **Auto-Nicknames:** Automatically populates nicknames based on character names when entering a valid raid instance (excludes LFR).
* **Guild Sorting:** Groups players by Guild in the configuration menu for easier management.
* **One-Click Clean:** Delete players or reset the entire database with a single click.
